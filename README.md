# JavaFxTutorialApp
Project built for class. Was to build a tutorial application that teaches the user and then tests the user on what they learned. The application opens up to a main menu where the user can choose to learn about colors or pets. Each lesson starts with a video of a song that the user is to watch. Once the video is completed the screen displays the test to the user about they learned in the lesson. There are 3 questions per tutorial.
